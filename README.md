# Finance Dashboard

This project was initially forked from [Gentelella Admin](https://github.com/Christianq010/gentelella) which is a free to use Bootstrap admin template.

This template uses the default Bootstrap 3 styles along with a variety of powerful jQuery plugins and tools to create a powerful framework for creating admin panels or back-end dashboards.

Theme uses several libraries for charts, calendar, form validation, wizard style interface, off-canvas navigation menu, text forms, date range, upload area, form autocomplete, range slider, progress bars, notifications and much more.
